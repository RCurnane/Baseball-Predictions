I was tasked to predict each player's on-base percentage in the 2021 season given only his plate appearances(PA) and on-base percentages(OBP) in prior seasons.  I was given a file that had over 500 players that needed to have their OBP predicted for the 2021 season.  This study and analysis will use machine learning techniques to uncover key factors influencing OBP and to develop models with high predictive accuracy. This analysis includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning to identify the most effective approach.
